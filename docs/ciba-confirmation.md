# CIBA confirmation: approval on the user's device

[keycloak-mcp-server](../README.md) › documentation

A destructive tool runs only after the caller approved it on their own device. Off by default; `examples/ciba-confirm/`
runs the whole thing.

## Why

The two usual ways to confirm a destructive tool prove little. `confirm: true` is written by the model. An elicitation
prompt is answered by the MCP client, and nothing says a human saw it. Both leave the decision inside the channel the
model controls.

The built-in `ciba` confirmer moves the decision out of that channel. Before a destructive tool runs, the server files
an authentication request for the signed-in user with the OpenID provider (OpenID Connect Client Initiated
Backchannel Authentication, CIBA). The provider delivers it to the user's device, the device shows who asks for what,
and the tool runs once the user approves there. Neither the model nor the MCP client takes part in that exchange.

## How a call goes

The default is the two-step flow:

1. **The first call files the request.** The server sends a CIBA authentication request to the provider for the
   caller: `login_hint` is their username (or the claim named by `login-hint`), `binding_message` is
   `<prefix>-<hash>` over tool, system, realm and arguments, and three additional parameters tell the device what is
   going on: `code`, a two-digit number; `requester`, the MCP client's name; and `operation`, for example
   `Delete user: dave (realm demo)`, with the system named when the server has several. The call answers
   `confirmation_required` at once with `approval: {status: requested, code, bindingMessage, expiresInSeconds}` and a
   `howTo` for the model.
2. **The model shows the number and calls again.** The `howTo` tells it to have the user approve on their device and
   enter the number, and to call again right away with the same arguments, without waiting for a reply.
3. **The device asks the user.** It shows the requester, the operation and the binding message, and asks for the
   number. The user approves or declines.
4. **The second call collects the decision.** It waits up to `poll-wait-seconds` for the device, polling the
   provider's token endpoint. Approved: the tool runs and the call answers like a direct one. Declined: `cancelled`.
   Still waiting: `confirmation_required` with `status: pending`, so the model calls again. Expired: `status: expired`,
   nothing was changed, and the next call files a new request.

The number works like Entra ID's number matching. It is shown where the request originates, the chat, and asked for
where it is approved, the device. A request the user did not trigger carries a number they cannot know, so approval
fatigue does not help someone who holds a stolen session.

**Blocking flow.** `flow=blocking` waits for the device inside the first call instead. There is no number, because
nothing could show it while the call waits. A request without an MCP session (no `Mcp-Session-Id`) always takes this
path, since nothing would tie a second call to the first.

## Any CIBA provider

The confirmer uses the standard flow only: discovery, the backchannel authentication endpoint, `login_hint`,
`binding_message` and poll mode. What differs per provider is the device side: a bank's app, a push notification, a
hardware token. Keycloak ships an HTTP authentication channel that posts each request to a URL of your choice and
forwards up to five additional parameters; the example's `approver` is such a URL, a small web app standing in for the
device. Keycloak allows 50 characters without spaces in the binding message.

## What makes the approval trustworthy

- **Bound to the full operation.** The approval's key is a SHA-256 over the MCP session, the caller, the issuer and
  the hash of tool, system, realm and arguments. The stored approval carries that hash, and the collecting call must
  match it. The device's binding message shows a 40-bit prefix of it, for people to compare.
- **One approval per session and operation.** The entry is reserved atomically in the `PendingApprovalStore` with an
  opaque generation that every later change names. A late filer whose reservation expired cannot overwrite the next
  one, and an old generation cannot be consumed. One collector at a time holds a short claim and polls the provider;
  parallel calls answer `pending` without polling. The claim is renewed before every poll and lasts the read timeout
  plus a margin, so it cannot run out during a slow poll. An approval the provider confirmed is recorded for its
  generation before it is consumed, so a collector that stalls afterwards cannot lose it. A decision is consumed once.
- **Who approved is verified.** The ID token the token endpoint returns on approval must verify against the
  provider's JWKS: signature, issuer, the CIBA client as audience, expiry. Its identity must be the person asked: the
  same `sub` as the MCP caller when their token comes from the same issuer, else the username or email of the login
  hint. Anything else answers `cancelled` with the reason and confirms nothing.
- **Nothing falls back to the model.** The confirmer refuses to start unless callers are required
  (`kc-mcp.require-caller`, a delegation mode or the `shared` profile). An anonymous or unaddressable caller gets
  `confirmation_required`, never the default confirmer's `confirm: true`. The one deliberate hand-over is
  `when=without-elicitation`, which leaves the question to clients that can ask the human themselves.
- **Several instances.** With the [database storage](storage.md) on, pending approvals live in
  `kc_mcp_pending_approval` (approval store `db`, the `auth_req_id` encrypted under the storage key, purged hourly),
  so the collecting call may reach any instance. Without the storage the in-memory store `memory-approvals` serves a single instance.

## Setup

On the Keycloak side, as in `examples/ciba-confirm/realms/demo-realm.json`:

- The realm's CIBA policy: delivery mode `poll`, how long a request lives (`cibaExpiresIn`, 120 s in the example),
  the polling interval, and `login_hint` as the way the user is identified.
- A confidential client for the server with *OIDC CIBA Grant* enabled (`mcp-ciba` in the example) and a secret.
- The HTTP authentication channel: a server-wide Keycloak option naming the URL that receives the requests,
  `--spi-ciba-auth-channel--ciba-http-auth-channel--http-authentication-channel-uri`. The address is global to the
  Keycloak server, not per realm.
- The device application behind that URL: it receives Keycloak's POST, lets the right user approve or decline, and
  answers Keycloak's callback. The example's `approver` shows the shape of it.
- Callers must be authenticated at the MCP server, because the login hint is the caller's username: forward or
  exchange delegation, or `kc-mcp.require-caller=true` ([Security](security.md#callers)).

On the server side, the example's `env/ciba.env` is a template:

```shell
KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_ENABLED=true
KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_CLIENT_ID=mcp-ciba
KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_CLIENT_SECRET=...
KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=90
KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_POLL_WAIT_SECONDS=25     # the second call waits this long, so the model notices the decision itself
KC_MCP_CONFIRM_FALLBACK=deny                       # no confirm: true for clients without elicitation
```

When the server reaches Keycloak at an internal address (Docker), set `issuer` to that address and `token-issuer` to
the public one the tokens name.

The model is told about the device by `kc-mcp.model-confirmation`: in `auto` it picks `server` whenever a confirmer
asks the human itself, so the model calls right away and relays the answer instead of asking "shall I really?"
([Guardrails](security.md#guardrails)). The `kc_mcp.ciba.*` metrics count requests and decisions by outcome
([Metrics](metrics.md)); alert on `rejected`, which means an approval's ID token was invalid or named someone else.

| `flow` | `two-step` | or `blocking` (the call waits for the device; no number matching) |
| `number-matching` | `true` | two-step: send a two-digit `code` the device asks the user for; shown to the model |
| `extra-parameters` | `true` | send `requester` and `operation` as additional request parameters |
| `poll-wait-seconds` | `5` | two-step: how long the collecting call waits for the device before answering `pending` |
