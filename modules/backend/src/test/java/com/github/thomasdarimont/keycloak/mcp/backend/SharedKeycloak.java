/**
 * One Keycloak for the integration tests of a test JVM, started on first use and removed
 * by Testcontainers when the JVM ends (not reused across runs, so every build starts from
 * an empty Keycloak): a Keycloak start takes about 25 seconds, and most test resources
 * need the same one. The test resources that use it ({@link KeycloakTestResource},
 * {@link ForwardTestResource} and its subclasses that do not customize the container,
 * {@link RealmManagerTestResource}) never stop it.
 * <p>
 * The rule for tests that use it: do not assume a fresh Keycloak. Earlier test classes
 * leave their realms, users, clients and settings behind. Use a realm or names of your
 * own, create what you need only when it is not there yet, and assert only on what you
 * created (no "exactly one realm", no total of the users of {@code master}). A test that
 * needs other server options (features, SPI settings) starts its own container with
 * {@link #newContainer()}.
