/**
 * A startup check of the deployment, next to the built-in ones of {@code kc-mcp.profile}:
 * an extension states what its own feature needs to be safe, say an audit file outside
 * {@code /tmp}, a ticket system URL over HTTPS, or a setting that must not be left at its
 * default on a shared server. Register with {@code @AutoService(ProfileCheck.class)} or
 * as a CDI bean; {@code kc-mcp.spi.<id>.enabled=false} switches one off.
 * <p>
 * The server runs every check at startup, after its own. All {@link #problems} of all
 * checks are reported together, each tagged with the check's id, and stop the start; a
 * check decides itself in which profiles a finding is a problem (typically only in
 * {@link Profile#SHARED}) and returns {@link #warnings} for the rest. A check that throws
 * stops the start in profile {@code shared} and is logged in {@code local}.
