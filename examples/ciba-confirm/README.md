# CIBA confirmation: destructive tools approved on the user's own device

Neither `confirm: true` nor elicitation proves that a human agreed to a destructive operation: the model writes the
first, the MCP client answers the second. This example asks the user directly instead, with OpenID Connect
**Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA)**:

1. Before a destructive tool runs, the MCP server sends an authentication request for the signed-in user to Keycloak.
2. Keycloak delivers it to the user's device, naming the operation.
3. The user approves there by entering a number shown in the chat, and the tool runs. The model never touches
   that channel.

## How it works

```
MCP client ──(OAuth 2.1 / PKCE)──▶ Keycloak            alice logs in, her token reaches the MCP server
   │ tools/call keycloak_user_delete {id, username}                                   (first call)
   ▼
MCP server (Confirmer chain: ciba confirmer)
   │ 1. POST backchannel_authentication_endpoint        client mcp-ciba, login_hint=alice,
   │                                                     binding_message=kc-mcp-<hash of tool+realm+args>,
   │                                                     code=42, requester=<MCP client>, operation=Delete user (realm demo)
   │ 2. answers confirmation_required at once           "approve on your device, the device asks for the number 42"
   │ 3. Keycloak → authentication channel → the device  here: the "approver" at http://localhost:8095/, which shows
   │                                                     who asks for what and asks the user for the number
   │ tools/call keycloak_user_delete {id, username}                                   (second call)
   │ 4. poll token endpoint (grant urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba): approved / declined / still pending / expired
   ▼
Admin REST API with alice's token (forward delegation)  → the user is deleted; declined → cancelled; pending → call again
```

- **Number matching**, as in Entra ID: the number is shown where the request starts (the chat) and asked for where
  it is approved (the device). A push the user did not trigger carries a number they cannot know, so approval
  fatigue does not help an attacker who holds a session.
- **Context on the device**: it shows the requester (the MCP client's name) and the operation with its target
  (`Delete user: dave (realm demo)`). Both are sent as additional CIBA request parameters, which Keycloak forwards.
- **Any CIBA provider**: the server uses only the standard flow (discovery, `backchannel_authentication_endpoint`,
  `login_hint`, `binding_message`, poll mode). Only the *authentication device* differs per provider: a bank's app,
  a push notification, a hardware token.
- **The device in this example** is the `approver` service. Keycloak's HTTP authentication channel POSTs each
  request to it. It is a small web app and a relying party of the same realm (public client `ciba-approver`, code
  flow with PKCE): users sign in, see only the requests meant for them, approve with the number or decline, and sign
  out again.

The MCP server is what CIBA calls the consumption device; it has no user-facing part in this flow.

## Start

```shell
cd examples/ciba-confirm
docker compose up -d        # Keycloak 26.8.2 on http://localhost:8098 (admin / admin), the approver on http://localhost:8095
```

Then run the MCP server on the host, **in a fresh shell** (see the note below):

```shell
cd ../..
set -a; source examples/ciba-confirm/env/ciba.env; set +a
./mvnw quarkus:dev -pl modules/backend -am     # MCP endpoint: http://localhost:8099/mcp
```

Or let compose run it from the packaged jar (`./mvnw package -DskipTests` first):

```shell
docker compose --profile mcp up -d --build
```

> A shell that has sourced another example's env file keeps the variables this one does not set, such as
> `QUARKUS_OIDC_RESOURCE_METADATA_SCOPES` from `delegated-auth`. The login then asks for scopes this realm does not
> have.

Users, all in realm `demo`:

| user | password | role |
|---|---|---|
| `alice` | `alice-demo` | realm admin |
| `carol` | `carol-demo` | `view-users` |
| `dave` | `dave-demo` | none |

## Run the demo

```shell
./demo.sh
```

| step | what happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | alice logs in; `whoami` shows her as the caller |
| 2 | alice creates a throw-away user and asks to delete it. The first call answers `confirmation_required` with a number. Her device shows the request: a wrong number is refused, the right one approves. The second call deletes the user |
| 3 | the same with a decline: the second call answers `cancelled` and the user stays |
| 4 | carol, signed in to the device as herself, sees none of alice's requests and cannot decide them |
| 5 | `confirm: true` changes nothing: the request reaches the device all the same |

The script plays alice's device with her access token, the way the browser holds her session.
`./demo.sh --users=5` only creates five users with random names, so there is someone to delete.

## Try it yourself

After `demo.sh` the realm still holds the users whose deletion was declined (`temp-…`). Delete one yourself and
approve it in the browser:

1. Open <http://localhost:8095/> and sign in as `alice` / `alice-demo`. This is alice's device.
2. Find a user to delete:

   ```shell
   ./mcp-call.py --login alice:alice-demo keycloak_user_search '{"search": "temp-"}' | jq -c '.items[] | {username, id}'
   ```

3. Ask to delete it. The answer is `confirmation_required` with the number, here 22:

   ```shell
   ./mcp-call.py --login alice:alice-demo keycloak_user_delete '{"id": "<id>", "username": "<username>"}'
   ```

   ```
   "message": "'Delete user: temp-aaf5627a (realm demo)' needs alice's approval on their device: ...
               The device asks for the number 22.",
   ```

4. The request appears on the page. Enter the number and approve, or decline.
5. Run the same command again. It deletes the user, or answers `cancelled` if you declined. Started before you
   decide, it waits up to 25 s for your decision.

Variations:

- Enter a wrong number: the page refuses it, and the request stays pending.
- Wait more than 90 s before deciding: the next call reports that the request expired, and the one after that
  files a new request.
- Sign in to the page as `carol`: alice's requests do not show up.
- Add `"confirm": true` to the arguments: it changes nothing.
- "Sign out" ends the session on the page and at Keycloak.

`mcp-call.py` keeps the MCP session between runs, as a real client does, because an approval belongs to the session
that asked for it. `--new-session` starts over.

### With an MCP client

LM Studio or another OAuth-capable client:

1. Add `mcp-oauth.json` and log in as `alice` / `alice-demo`.
2. Ask it to delete a user (`./demo.sh --users=3` creates some).
3. Approve or decline on the device page, signed in as alice. The model's answer names the binding message and the
   number, so you can tell which request belongs to which operation.

The model calls the tool again at once, and that call waits up to 25 s (`KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_POLL_WAIT_SECONDS`)
for your decision, so you need not write in the chat. A small model may still stop and ask; then say "done".

## What to look at

| where | what |
|---|---|
| `env/ciba.env` | `KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_*`: client, timeout, `when`, `login-hint`, `client-auth`, `flow`, `number-matching`. `KC_MCP_CONFIRM_FALLBACK=deny`, so a client without elicitation cannot fall back to `confirm: true` |
| `realms/demo-realm.json` | the realm's CIBA policy (`cibaInterval`, `cibaExpiresIn`, `login_hint` as the user hint); the confidential client `mcp-ciba` with `oidc.ciba.grant.enabled`; the public client `mcp-consumer`, whose tokens carry `aud=mcp-admin`; the public client `ciba-approver` the device signs its users in with |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Keycloak's `--spi-ciba-auth-channel--ciba-http-auth-channel--http-authentication-channel-uri`, pointing at the approver |
| `approver/Approver.java` | the device, plain JDK, no build (below) |
| the server log | `CIBA request …<id> for alice: keycloak_user_delete realm demo (binding message kc-mcp-…, code 42, up to 90 s)`, then `approved by alice` or `declined by alice`, then the audit line of the tool call |

**The approver.** Its contract with Keycloak: answer the request with `201`, later `POST {"status": "SUCCEED" |
"CANCELLED"}` with Keycloak's bearer token to `/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/ext/ciba/auth/callback`.

- It reads `code`, `requester` and `operation` from the request: Keycloak forwards additional CIBA request
  parameters as top-level JSON fields.
- It shows a request only to the signed-in user it names (`login_hint` = username or email), and refuses an
  approval whose number does not match.
- It learns who the user is from the `userinfo` endpoint, after the code exchange in the browser or for a bearer
  token in scripts: `GET /pending`, `POST /approve/{id|latest}?code=NN`, `POST /decline/{id|latest}`,
  `POST /decline-all`, `POST /history/clear`.
- The page lists requests newest first, with "Decline all" above several pending ones and "Clear" above the
  decided ones.

## Beyond the demo

- **Other providers.** Point `KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_ISSUER` at the provider, or leave `caller` to follow the
  issuer of the caller's token. Register a confidential CIBA client there.
  - In a container that reaches the provider at an internal URL, set that URL as the issuer and the public one as
    `TOKEN_ISSUER`, as `docker-compose.yml` does.
  - `client-auth=client_secret_post` for providers that do not take HTTP Basic.
  - `login-hint`: the claim the provider resolves users by (`email`, `sub`, ...).
  - `requested-expiry=true` asks the provider to keep the request as long as the server waits.
  - `binding-message=false` drops the message for providers that reject it.
- **Clients with elicitation.** `KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_WHEN=without-elicitation` keeps CIBA for clients that
  cannot ask the human, and lets the others (Claude Desktop, ...) ask in the chat.
- **Several MCP server instances.** Turn the database storage on (`QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL`, PostgreSQL build).
  Pending approvals then live in `kc_mcp_pending_approval`, and the second call may reach any instance. This example
  runs one instance with the in-memory store.
- **One call instead of two.** `KC_MCP_SPI_CONFIRMER_CIBA_FLOW=blocking` makes the tool call wait for the device.
  Simpler for scripts, but the chat shows nothing while waiting, so there is no number to match (`number-matching`
  only applies to the two-step flow).
- **Simple devices.** Devices that cannot show additional parameters still get the binding message;
  `extra-parameters=false` stops sending them.
- **Which tools.** Only DESTRUCTIVE tools are confirmed; `keycloak_realm_update` and `keycloak_auth_flow_bind` count
  as such. Other `Confirmer`s (a change ticket check, see `examples/extensions`) run before this one and may confirm
  or decline first.
